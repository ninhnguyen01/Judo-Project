Kodokan Judo

Judo techniques were divided into three categories: throws or nage waza, controls or katame waza and kicks or atemi waza. In competition, atemi waza are not allowed.

Judo is taught through randori, free practice, kata, imposed forms, and mondo, exchanges based on the values, the philosophy or any subject related to judo, between the students and their teacher.
